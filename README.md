# BUSAA Web Application
Welcome to the BUSAA Web Application! This project showcases my skills in web application development using Express.js. It was developed as part of my course project for COSI 152A - Web Application Development at Brandeis University. The application is designed to meet the requirements of the Brandeis University Student and Alumni Association (BUSAA) and provides a platform for students and alumni to connect, share job opportunities, post events, and communicate in real-time.  

## Features
* User Authentication: Secure user authentication system allows users to sign up, log in, and log out. Only authenticated users can access certain features and functionalities.
* Job Opportunities: Users can post job opportunities, including job title, company name, location, and description. Job postings are visible to all users, providing a platform to share and explore employment prospects.
* Events: Users can post upcoming events, including event title, date and time, location, and description. The event listings allow users to discover and participate in various activities happening within the BUSAA community.
* Real-time Chat: The application includes a chat feature that enables authenticated users to engage in real-time conversations. Users can join different chat channels, exchange messages, and build connections within the BUSAA network.
* API for Events: An API is available to provide a list of upcoming events in JSON format. The API is secured with unique tokens for each user, ensuring data privacy and authorized access.
* Event Modal: An interactive event modal displays a list of upcoming events and allows users to easily join an event with a single click. This intuitive feature enhances user experience and encourages event participation.
* MVC Structure: The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase. The clear separation of concerns allows for easy development, testing, and future enhancements.
* Route Modules: Routes are organized into different modules, such as userRoutes, jobRoutes, and eventRoutes. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability, facilitating future updates and additions.
* Flash Messages and Comments: Flash messages are implemented to provide informative feedback to users regarding the success or failure of operations. Additionally, the code includes detailed comments to enhance code comprehension and facilitate collaboration.
